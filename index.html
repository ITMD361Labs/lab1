<h1>  ITMD-361 Lab 1 Personal Introduction </h1> 
  <p>Hello world. This is my second or third "hello world" website!</p>
  <p>My name is Oleksandr Lemeha and I am a third year computer science major student at IIT.</p>
  <p>I like miniature objects and constructing miniature buildings. Currently I am working on a coffee shop.</p>
  <p>I took private classes on Quality Assurance during high school, which taught me a little of HTML.</p>
  <p>I am looking forward to learning more in this class and making my own website!</p>
